Battleship Game
This is a browser-based game of battleship that allows players to compete against each other by strategically placing their ships and trying to sink their opponent's fleet.

How to Play

During the game, players take turns guessing the locations of their opponent's ships by clicking on cells on the board. If a ship is hit, the player will be notified and can continue guessing until they miss. The game continues until one player has sunk all of their opponent's ships.
